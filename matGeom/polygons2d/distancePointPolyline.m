function [minDist, pos] = distancePointPolyline(point, poly, varargin)
%DISTANCEPOINTPOLYLINE  Compute shortest distance between a point and a polyline.
%
%   DIST = distancePointPolyline(POINT, POLYLINE)
%   Returns the shortest distance between a point given as a 1-by-2 row
%   vector, and a polyline given as a NV-by-2 array of coordinates.
%
%   If POINT is a NP-by-2 array, the result DIST is a NP-by-1 array,
%   containig the distance of each point to the polyline.
%
%   [DIST, POS] = distancePointPolyline(POINT, POLYLINE)
%   Also returns the relative position of the point projected on the
%   polyline, between 0 and NV, the number of polyline vertices.
%
%   ... = distancePointPolyline(POINT, POLYLINE, CLOSED)
%   Specifies if the polyline is closed or not. CLOSED can be one of:
%   * 'closed' -> the polyline is closed
%   * 'open' -> the polyline is open
%     a column vector of logical with the same number of elements as the
%       number of points -> specify individually if each polyline is
%       closed (true=closed).
%
%
%   Example:
%       pt1 = [30 20];
%       pt2 = [30 5];
%       poly = [10 10;50 10;50 50;10 50];
%       distancePointPolyline([pt1;pt2], poly)
%       ans =
%           10
%            5
