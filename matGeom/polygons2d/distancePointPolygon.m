function minDist = distancePointPolygon(point, poly)
%DISTANCEPOINTPOLYGON Shortest distance between a point and a polygon.
%
%   DIST = distancePointPolygon(POINT, POLYGON)
%   Computes the shortest distance between the point POINT and the polygon
%   given by POLYGON. POINT is a 1-by-2 row vector, and POLYGON is a N-by-2
%   array containing vertex coordinates.
%   The distance is computed as the minimal distance to the boundary edges.
%
%   Example
%     % Computes the distance between a point and a square
%     square = [0 0; 10 0;10 10;0 10];
%     p0 = [16 3];
%     distancePointPolygon(p0, square)
%     ans =
%          6
