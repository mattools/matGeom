function P = InterX(L1,varargin)
%INTERX Intersection of curves.
%   P = INTERX(L1,L2) returns the intersection points of two curves L1 
%   and L2. The curves L1,L2 can be either closed or open and are described
%   by two-row-matrices, where each row contains its x- and y- coordinates.
%   The intersection of groups of curves (e.g. contour lines, multiply 
%   connected regions etc) can also be computed by separating them with a
%   column of NaNs as for example
%
%         L  = [x11 x12 x13 ... NaN x21 x22 x23 ...;
%               y11 y12 y13 ... NaN y21 y22 y23 ...]
%
%   P has the same structure as L1 and L2, and its rows correspond to the
%   x- and y- coordinates of the intersection points of L1 and L2. If no
%   intersections are found, the returned P is empty.
%
%   P = INTERX(L1) returns the self-intersection points of L1. To keep
%   the code simple, the points at which the curve is tangent to itself are
%   not included. P = INTERX(L1,L1) returns all the points of the curve 
%   together with any self-intersection points.
%   
%   Example:
%       t = linspace(0,2*pi);
%       r1 = sin(4*t)+2;  x1 = r1.*cos(t); y1 = r1.*sin(t);
%       r2 = sin(8*t)+2;  x2 = r2.*cos(t); y2 = r2.*sin(t);
%       P = InterX([x1;y1],[x2;y2]);
%       plot(x1,y1,x2,y2,P(1,:),P(2,:),'ro')
%
%   Two words about the algorithm: Most of the code is self-explanatory.
%   The only trick lies in the calculation of C1 and C2. To be brief, this
%   is essentially the two-dimensional analog of the condition that needs
%   to be satisfied by a function F(x) that has a zero in the interval
%   [a,b], namely
%           F(a)*F(b) <= 0
%   C1 and C2 exactly do this for each segment of curves 1 and 2
%   respectively. If this condition is satisfied simultaneously for two
%   segments then we know that they will cross at some point. 
%   Each factor of the 'C' arrays is essentially a matrix containing 
%   the numerators of the signed distances between points of one curve
%   and line segments of the other.
