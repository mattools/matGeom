function [intersects, edgeIndices] = intersectRayPolygon(ray, poly, varargin)
%INTERSECTRAYPOLYGON Intersection points between a ray and a polygon.
%
%   PTS = intersectRayPolygon(RAY, POLY)
%   Returns the intersection points of the ray RAY with polygon POLY. 
%   RAY is a 1x4 array containing parametric representation of the ray
%   (in the form [x0 y0 dx dy], see createRay for details). 
%   POLY is a N-by-2 array containing coordinates of polygon vertices.
%   
%   [PTS, INDS] = intersectRayPolygon(...)
%   Also returns index of polygon intersected edge(s). See
%   intersectLinePolygon for details.
