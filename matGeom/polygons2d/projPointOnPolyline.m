function varargout = projPointOnPolyline(point, poly, varargin)
%PROJPOINTONPOLYLINE Compute position of a point projected on a polyline.
%
%   POS = projPointOnPolyline(POINT, POLYLINE)
%   Compute the position of the orthogonal projection of a point on a
%   polyline.
%   POINT is a 1-by-2 row vector containing point coordinates
%   POLYLINE is a N-by-2 array containing coordinates of polyline vertices
%   POS is the position of the point on the polyline, between 0 and the
%   number of vertices of the polyline. POS can be a non-integer value, in
%   this case, the integer part corresponds to the polyline edge index
%   (between 0 and Nv-1), and the floating-point part corresponds to the
%   relative position on i-th edge (between 0 and 1, 0: edge start, 1: edge
%   end).
%
%   When POINT is an array of points, returns a column vector with as many
%   rows as the number of points.
%
%   POS = projPointOnPolyline(POINT, POLYLINE, CLOSED)
%   Specifies if the polyline is closed or not. CLOSED can be one of:
%     'closed' -> the polyline is closed
%     'open' -> the polyline is open
%     a column vector of logical with the same number of elements as the
%       number of points -> specify individually if each polyline is
%       closed (true=closed).
%
%   [POS, DIST] = projPointOnPolyline(...)
%   Also returns the distance between POINT and POLYLINE.
%
%   Example
%     poly = [10 10; 20 10;20 20;10 20];
%     projPointOnPolyline([15 0], poly)
%     ans =
%         0.5000
%     projPointOnPolyline([0 16], poly)
%     ans =
%         3.0000
