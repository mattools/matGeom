function dist = distancePolylines(poly1, poly2)
%DISTANCEPOLYLINES Compute the shortest distance between 2 polylines.
%
%   DIST = distancePolylines(POLY1, POLY2)
%   POLY1 and POLY2 should be two polylines represented by their list of
%   vertices.

% compute distance of each vertex of a polyline to the other polyline
dist1   = min(distancePointPolyline(poly1, poly2));
dist2   = min(distancePointPolyline(poly2, poly1));

% keep the minimum of the two distances
dist = min(dist1, dist2);
