%INTERSECTPOLYLINES Find the common points between 2 polylines.
%
%   INTERS = intersectPolylines(POLY1, POLY2)
%   Returns the intersection points between two polylines. Each polyline is
%   defined by a N-by-2 array representing coordinates of its vertices: 
%   [X1 Y1 ; X2 Y2 ; ... ; XN YN]
%   INTERS is a NP-by-2 array containing coordinates of intersection
%   points.
%
%   INTERS = intersectPolylines(POLY1)
%   Compute self-intersections of the polyline.
%
%   Example
%   % Compute intersection points between 2 simple polylines
%     poly1 = [20 10 ; 20 50 ; 60 50 ; 60 10];
%     poly2 = [10 40 ; 30 40 ; 30 60 ; 50 60 ; 50 40 ; 70 40];

%INTERX Intersection of curves
%   P = INTERX(L1,L2) returns the intersection points of two curves L1 
%   and L2. The curves L1,L2 can be either closed or open and are described
%   by two-row-matrices, where each row contains its x- and y- coordinates.
%   The intersection of groups of curves (e.g. contour lines, multiply 
%   connected regions etc) can also be computed by separating them with a
%   column of NaNs as for example
%
%         L  = [x11 x12 x13 ... NaN x21 x22 x23 ...;
%               y11 y12 y13 ... NaN y21 y22 y23 ...]
%
%   P has the same structure as L1 and L2, and its rows correspond to the
%   x- and y- coordinates of the intersection points of L1 and L2. If no
%   intersections are found, the returned P is empty.
%
%   P = INTERX(L1) returns the self-intersection points of L1. To keep
%   the code simple, the points at which the curve is tangent to itself are
%   not included. P = INTERX(L1,L1) returns all the points of the curve 
%   together with any self-intersection points.
%   
%   Example:
%       t = linspace(0,2*pi);
%       r1 = sin(4*t)+2;  x1 = r1.*cos(t); y1 = r1.*sin(t);
%       r2 = sin(8*t)+2;  x2 = r2.*cos(t); y2 = r2.*sin(t);
%       P = InterX([x1;y1],[x2;y2]);
%       plot(x1,y1,x2,y2,P(1,:),P(2,:),'ro')

%   Two words about the algorithm: Most of the code is self-explanatory.
%   The only trick lies in the calculation of C1 and C2. To be brief, this
%   is essentially the two-dimensional analog of the condition that needs
%   to be satisfied by a function F(x) that has a zero in the interval
%   [a,b], namely
%           F(a)*F(b) <= 0
%   C1 and C2 exactly do this for each segment of curves 1 and 2
%   respectively. If this condition is satisfied simultaneously for two
%   segments then we know that they will cross at some point. 
%   Each factor of the 'C' arrays is essentially a matrix containing 
%   the numerators of the signed distances between points of one curve
%   and line segments of the other.
