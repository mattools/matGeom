function [nodes, edges] = medialAxisConvex(points)
%MEDIALAXISCONVEX Compute medial axis of a convex polygon.
%
%   [N, E] = medialAxisConvex(POLYGON);
%   where POLYGON is given as a set of points [x1 y1;x2 y2 ...], returns
%   the medial axis of the polygon as a graph.
%   N is a set of nodes. The first elements of N are the vertices of the
%   original polygon.
%   E is a set of edges, containing indices of source and target nodes.
%   Edges are sorted according to order of creation. Index of first vertex
%   is lower than index of last vertex, i.e. edges always point to newly
%   created nodes.
%
%   Notes:
%   - Is not fully implemented, need more development (usually crashes for
%       polygons with more than 6-7 points...)
%   - Works only for convex polygons.
%   - Complexity is not optimal: this algorithm is O(n*log n), but linear
%   algorithms exist.
