function loops = expandPolygon(poly, dist, varargin)
%EXPANDPOLYGON Expand a polygon by a given (signed) distance.
%
%   POLY2 = expandPolygon(POLY, DIST);
%   Associates to each edge of the polygon POLY the parallel line located
%   at distance DIST from the current edge, and compute intersections with
%   neighbor parallel lines. The input polygon POLY must be oriented
%   counter-clockwise. Otherwise, distance is computed inside the polygon.
%   The resulting polygon is simplified to remove inner "loops", and can
%   eventually be disconnected. 
%   The result POLY2 is a cell array, each cell containing a simple linear
%   ring. 
%   
%   This is a kind of dilation, but behaviour on corners is different.
%   This function keeps angles of polygons, but there is no direct relation
%   between the lengths of each polygon.
%
%   It is also possible to specify negative distance, and get all points
%   inside the polygon. If the polygon is convex, the result equals
%   morphological erosion of polygon by a ball with radius equal to the
%   given distance.
%
%   Example:
%   % Computes the negative offset of a non-convex polygon
%     poly = [10 10;30 10;30 30;20 20;10 30];
%     poly2 = expandPolygon(poly, -3);
%     figure;
%     drawPolygon(poly, 'linewidth', 2);
%     hold on; drawPolygon(poly2, 'm')
%     axis equal; axis([0 40 0 40]);
