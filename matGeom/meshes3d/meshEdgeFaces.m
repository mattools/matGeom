function edgeFaces = meshEdgeFaces(vertices, edges, faces) %#ok<INUSL>
%MESHEDGEFACES Compute index of faces adjacent to each edge of a mesh.
%
%   EF = meshEdgeFaces(V, E, F)
%   Compute index array of faces adjacent to each edge of a mesh.
%   V, E and F define the mesh: V is vertex array, E contains vertex
%   indices of edge extremities, and F contains vertex indices of each
%   face, either as a numerical array or as a cell array.
%   The result EF has as many rows as the number of edges, and two column.
%   The first column contains index of faces located on the left of the
%   corresponding edge, whereas the second column contains index of the
%   face located on the right. Some indices may be 0 if the mesh is not
%   'closed'.
%   
%   Note: a faster version is available for triangular meshes.
%
%   Example
%   meshEdgeFaces
