function vol = meshVolume(varargin)
%MESHVOLUME (Signed) volume of the space enclosed by a polygonal mesh.
%
%   V = meshVolume(VERTS, FACES)
%   Computes the volume of the space enclosed by the polygonal mesh
%   represented by vertices VERTS (as a Nv-by-3 array of cooridnates) and
%   the array of faces FACES (either as a Nf-by-3 array of vertex indices,
%   or as a cell array of arrays of vertex indices).
%
%   The volume is computed as the sum of the signed volumes of tetrahedra
%   formed by triangular faces and the centroid of the mesh. Faces need to
%   be oriented such that normal points outwards the mesh. See:
%   http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1838401/general-formula-to-calculate-polyhedron-volume
%
%   Example
%     % computes the volume of a unit cube (should be equal to 1...)
%     [v f] = createCube;
%     meshVolume(v, f)
%     ans = 
%         1
