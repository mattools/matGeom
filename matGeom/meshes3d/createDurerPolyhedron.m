%CREATEDURERPOLYHEDRON  Create a mesh representing Durer's polyhedron .
%
%   [V, F] = createDurerPolyhedron
%   [V, E, F] = createDurerPolyhedron
%   Returns a mesh data structure that represents Durer's polyhedron shown
%   in "Melancholia". Vertices are stored in V as Nv-by-3 array of 3D
%   coordinates, faces are stored in Nf-by-1 cell array containing the
%   vertex indices of each face.
%   Several hypotheses exist on the exact geometry of the solid. The one
%   described in Mathworld (see references) is used here.
%
%   Durer's polyhedron is generated from a centered unit cube. Several
%   transforms are applied succesively:
%   * Rotation around Oz by PI / 4
%   * Rotation around Oy by asec(sqrt(3))
%   * z-scaling by sqrt(1 + 3 / sqrt(5) )
%   * truncation by two horizontal planes located at a distance of 
%       (3 - sqrt(5)) / 2 from each azimutal vertex.
%
%   Durer's polyhedron is composed of six pentagonal faces and 2 triangular
%   faces. Pentagonal faces have angles 126, 108, 72, 108, and 126 degrees.
%   triangular faces are equilateral.
%
%   Example
%     % Display Durer's polyhedron 
%     [v f] = createDurerPolyhedron;
%     figure; hold on; set(gcf, 'renderer', 'opengl');
%     drawMesh(v, f, 'FaceColor', [.7 .7 .7]);
%     axis equal; axis([-1 1 -1 1 -1 1]);
%     view(3)
