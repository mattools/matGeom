%REMOVEMESHEARS Remove vertices that are connected to only one face.

%   [V, F] = removeMeshEars(V, F)
%   [V, F] = removeMeshEars(MESH)
%   Remove vertices that are connected to only one face. This removes also
%   "pending" faces.
%   Note that if the mesh has boundary, this may remove some regular faces
%   located on the boundary.
