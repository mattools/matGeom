%GRAPH2CONTOURS Convert a graph to a set of contour curves.
% 
%   CONTOURS = GRAPH2CONTOURS(NODES, EDGES)
%   NODES, EDGES is a graph representation (type "help graphs" for details)
%   The algorithm assume every node has degree 2, and the set of edges
%   forms only closed loops. The result is a list of indices arrays, each
%   array containing consecutive point indices of a contour.
%
%   To transform contours into drawable curves, please use :
%   CURVES{i} = NODES(CONTOURS{i}, :);
%
%
%   NOTE : contours are not oriented. To manage contour orientation, edges
%   also need to be oriented. So we must precise generation of edges.
