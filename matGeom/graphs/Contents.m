%CONTENTS GRAPHS Simple Toolbox for manipulating Geometric Graphs.
% Version 0.6 04-Sep-2017 .
%
%   The aim of this package is to provide functions to easily create,  
%   modify and display geometric graphs (geometric in a sense position
%   nodes are associated to geometric position in 2D or 3D).
%
%   Graph are represented by a structure with at least two arrays:
%   * NODES, which contains coordinates of each vertex
%   * EDGES, which contains indices of start and end vertex.
%   Some graph functions consider adjacency list, as a cell array where
%   each cell contains the indices of the neighbor vertices.
%
%   Others arrays may sometimes be used:
%   * FACES, which contains indices of vertices of each face (either a
%       double array, or a cell array)
%   * CELLS, which contains indices of faces of each cell.
%
%   An alternative representation is to use a structure, with fields:
%   * 'nodes'
%   * 'edges'
%   corresponding to the data described above.
%
%   Note that topological description of 2D graph is entirely contained in
%   EDGES array, and that NODES array is used only to display the graph.
%   
%   Caution: this type of data structure is easy to create and to manage,
%   but may be very inefficient for some algorithms. 
%
%   Graphs are usually considered as non-oriented in this package.
