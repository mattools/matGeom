%RELATIVENEIGHBORHOODGRAPH Relative Neighborhood Graph of a set of points.
%
%   [NODES, EDGES] = relativeNeighborhoodGraph(POINTS)
%   EDGES = relativeNeighborhoodGraph(POINTS)
%
%   The Relative Neighborhood Graph (RNG) is a subgraph of the Delaunay
%   Triangulation computed from the same set of points. The Gabriel graph
%   and the euclidean minimal spanning tree (EMST) are subgraphs of the
%   RNG.
%
%   Example
%     nodes = rand(100, 2) * 100;
%     edges = relativeNeighborhoodGraph(nodes);
%     figure; drawGraph(nodes, edges);
