function path = grFindMaximalLengthPath(nodes, edges, edgeWeights)
%GRFINDMAXIMALLENGTHPATH Find a path that maximizes sum of edge weights.
%
%   PATH = grFindMaximalLengthPath(NODES, EDGES, EDGE_WEIGHTS);
%   Finds a greatest geodesic path in the graph. A path between two nodes
%   is a succession of adjacent edges that link the first and last nodes.
%   the length of the path is the sum of weights of edges that constitute
%   the path.
%   A geodesic path is a path that minimizes the length of the path among
%   the set of paths between the nodes.
%   A maximal length path maximizes the length of the geodesic path between
%   couples of nodes in the graph
%
%   The result PATH is the list of edge indices that constitutes the path.
%
%   PATH = grFindMaximalLengthPath(NODES, EDGES);
%   Assumes each edge has a weight equal to 1.
