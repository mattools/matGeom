function area = polygonArea3d(poly, varargin)
%POLYGONAREA3D Area of a 3D polygon.
%
%   AREA = polygonArea3d(POLY)
%   POLY is given as a N-by-3 array of vertex coordinates. The resulting
%   area is positive.
%   Works also for polygons given as a cell array of polygons.
%
%   Example
%     % area of a simple 3D square 
%     poly = [10 30 20;20 30 20;20 40 20;10 40 20];
%     polygonArea3d(poly)
%     ans =
%        100
%
%     % Area of a 3D mesh
%     [v f] = createCubeOctahedron;
%     polygons = meshFacePolygons(v, f);
%     areas = polygonArea3d(polygons);
%     sum(areas)
%     ans =
%         18.9282
