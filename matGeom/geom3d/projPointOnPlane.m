function point = projPointOnPlane(point, plane)
%PROJPOINTONPLANE Return the orthogonal projection of a point on a plane.
%
%   PT2 = projPointOnPlane(PT1, PLANE);
%   Compute the (orthogonal) projection of point PT1 onto the plane PLANE,
%   given as [X0 Y0 Z0  VX1 VY1 VZ1  VX2 VY2 VZ2] (origin point, first
%   direction vector, second directionvector).
%   
%   The function is fully vectorized, in that multiple points may be
%   projected onto multiple planes in a single call, returning multiple
%   points. With the exception of the second dimension (where
%   SIZE(PT1,2)==3, and SIZE(PLANE,2)==9), each dimension of PT1 and PLANE
%   must either be equal or one, similar to the requirements of BSXFUN. In
%   basic usage, point PT1 is a [N*3] array, and PLANE is a [N*9] array
%   (see createPlane for details). Result PT2 is a [N*3] array, containing
%   coordinates of orthogonal projections of PT1 onto planes PLANE. In
%   vectorised usage, PT1 is an [N*3*M*P...] matrix, and PLANE is an
%   [X*9*Y...] matrix, where (N,X), (M,Y), etc, are either equal pairs, or
%   one of the two is one.
