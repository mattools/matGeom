function plane2 = normalizePlane(plane1)
%NORMALIZEPLANE Normalize parametric representation of a plane.
%
%   PLANE2 = normalizePlane(PLANE1);
%   Transforms the plane PLANE1 in the following format:
%   [X0 Y0 Z0  DX1 DY1 DZ1  DX2 DY2 DZ2], where:
%   - (X0, Y0, Z0) is a point belonging to the plane
%   - (DX1, DY1, DZ1) is a first direction vector
%   - (DX2, DY2, DZ2) is a second direction vector
%   into another plane, with the same format, but with:
%   - (x0 y0 z0) is the closest point of plane to the origin
%   - (DX1 DY1 DZ1) has norm equal to 1
%   - (DX2 DY2 DZ2) has norm equal to 1 and is orthogonal to (DX1 DY1 DZ1)
