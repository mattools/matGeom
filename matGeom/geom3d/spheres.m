function spheres(varargin)
%SPHERES Description of functions operating on 3D spheres.
%
%   Spheres are represented by their center and their radius:
%   S = [xc yc zc r];
%
%   An ellipsoid is defined by:
%   ELL = [XC YC ZC  A B C  PHI THETA PSI]
%   where [XC YC ZY] is the center, [A B C] are length of semi-axes (in
%   decreasing order), and [PHI THETA PSI] are euler angles representing
%   the ellipsoid orientation.
