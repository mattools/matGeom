function pos = linePosition3d(point, line)
%LINEPOSITION3D Return the position of a 3D point projected on a 3D line.
%
%   T = linePosition3d(POINT, LINE)
%   Computes position of point POINT on the line LINE, relative to origin
%   point and direction vector of the line.
%   LINE has the form [x0 y0 z0 dx dy dy],
%   POINT has the form [x y z], and is assumed to belong to line.
%   The result T is the value such that POINT = LINE(1:3) + T * LINE(4:6).
%   If POINT does not belong to LINE, the position of its orthogonal
%   projection is computed instead. 
%
%   T = linePosition3d(POINT, LINES)
%   If LINES is an array of NL lines, return NL positions, corresponding to
%   each line.
%
%   T = linePosition3d(POINTS, LINE)
%   If POINTS is an array of NP points, return NP positions, corresponding
%   to each point.
