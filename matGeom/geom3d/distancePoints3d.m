function dist = distancePoints3d(p1, p2, varargin)
%DISTANCEPOINTS3D Compute euclidean distance between pairs of 3D Points.
%
%   D = distancePoints3d(P1, P2) return distance between points P1 and
%   P2, given as [X Y Z].
%   
%   If P1 and P2 are two arrays of points, result is a N1*N2 array
%   containing distance between each point of P1 and each point of P2. 
%
%
%   D = distancePoints3d(P1, P2, NOR)
%   with NOR being 1, 2, or Inf, corresponfing to the norm used. Default is
%   2 (euclidean norm). 1 correspond to manhattan (or taxi driver) distance
%   and Inf to maximum difference in each coordinate.
