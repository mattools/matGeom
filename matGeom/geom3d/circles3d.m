function circles3d(varargin)
%CIRCLES3D Description of functions operating on 3D circles.
%
%   Circles are represented by a center, a radius and a 3D angle
%   representing the normal of the plane containing the circle. 
%   C = [xc yc zc R theta phi psi].
%   THETA is the colatitude of the normal, in degrees, between 0 and 180
%   PHI is the azimut of the normal, in degrees, between 0 and 360
%   PSI is the proper rotation of the circle around the normal, between 0
%       and 360 degrees
%   The parameter PSI is used to locate a point on the 3D circle.
