function n = vectorNorm3d(v)
%VECTORNORM3D Norm of a 3D vector or of set of 3D vectors.
%
%   N = vectorNorm3d(V);
%   Returns the norm of vector V.
%
%   When V is a N-by-3 array, compute norm for each vector of the array.
%   Vectors are given as rows. Result is then a N-by-1 array.
%
%   NOTE: Computes only the Euclidean norm.
