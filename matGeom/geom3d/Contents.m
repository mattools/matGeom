%CONTENTS GEOM3D Geometry 3D Toolbox.
% Version 1.22 06-Jun-2018 .
%
%   Creation, transformations, algorithms and visualization of geometrical
%   3D primitives, such as points, lines, planes, polyhedra, circles and
%   spheres.
%   
%   Euler Angles are defined as follow:
%   PHI is the azimut, i.e. the angle of the projection on horizontal plane
%   with the Ox axis, with value beween 0 and 180 degrees.
%   THETA is the latitude, i.e. the angle with the Oz axis, with value
%   between -90 and +90 degrees.
%   PSI is the 'roll', i.e. the rotation around the (PHI, THETA) direction,
%   with value in degrees
%   See also the 'angles3d' page.
%
%   Base format for primitives:
%   Point:      [x0 y0 z0]
%   Vector:     [dx dy dz]
%   Line:       [x0 y0 z0 dx dy dz]
%   Edge:       [x1 y1 z1 x2 y2 z2]
%   Plane:      [x0 y0 z0 dx1 dy1 dz1 dx2 dy2 dz2]
%   Sphere:     [x0 y0 z0 R]
%   Circle:     [x0 y0 z0 R PHI THETA PSI] (origin+center+normal+'roll').
%   Ellipsoid:  [x0 y0 z0 A B C PHI THETA PSI]

%   Polygons are represented by N-by-3 array of points, the last point is
%   not necessarily the same as the first one. Points must be coplanar.
