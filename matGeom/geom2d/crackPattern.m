%CRACKPATTERN Create a (bounded) crack pattern tessellation.
%
%   E = crackPattern(BOX, POINTS, ALPHA)
%   create a crack propagation pattern wit following parameters :
%   - pattern is bounded by area BOX given by [xmin xmax ymin ymax].
%   - each crack originates from points given in POINTS
%   - direction of each crack is given by array ALPHA
%   - a crack stop when it reaches another already created crack. 
%   - all cracks stop when they reach the border of the frame, given by box
%   (a serie of 4 points).
%   The result is a collection of edges, in the form [x1 y1 x2 y2].
%
%   E = crackPattern(BOX, POINTS, ALPHA, SPEED)
%   Also specify speed of propagation of each crack.
%
%
%   See the result with :
