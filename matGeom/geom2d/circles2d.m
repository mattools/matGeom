function circles2d(varargin)
%CIRCLES2D Description of functions operating on circles.
%
%   Circles are represented by their center and their radius:
%   C = [xc yc r];
%   One sometimes considers orientation of circle, by adding an extra
%   boolean value in 4-th position, with value TRUE for direct (i.e.
%   turning Counter-clockwise) circles.
%
%   Circle arcs are represented by their center, their radius, the starting
%   angle and the angle extent, both in degrees:
%   CA = [xc yc r theta0 dtheta];
%   
%   Ellipses are represented by their center, their 2 semi-axis length, and
%   their angle (in degrees) with Ox direction.
%   E = [xc yc A B theta];
