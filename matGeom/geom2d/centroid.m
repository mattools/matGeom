function center = centroid(varargin)
%CENTROID Compute centroid (center of mass) of a set of points.
%
%   PTS = centroid(POINTS)
%   PTS = centroid(PTX, PTY)
%   Computes the ND-dimensional centroid of a set of points. 
%   POINTS is an array with as many rows as the number of points, and as
%   many columns as the number of dimensions. 
%   PTX and PTY are two column vectors containing coordinates of the
%   2-dimensional points.
%   The result PTS is a row vector with Nd columns.
%
%   PTS = centroid(POINTS, MASS)
%   PTS = centroid(PTX, PTY, MASS)
%   Computes center of mass of POINTS, weighted by coefficient MASS.
%   POINTS is a Np-by-Nd array, MASS is Np-by-1 array, and PTX and PTY are
%   also both Np-by-1 arrays.
%
%   Example:
%   pts = [2 2;6 1;6 5;2 4];
%   centroid(pts)
%   ans =
%        4     3
