function [dists, neighInds] = nndist(points)
%NNDIST Nearest-neighbor distances of each point in a set.
%
%   DISTS = nndist(POINTS)
%   Returns the distance to the nearest neighbor of each point in an array
%   of points.
%   POINTS is an array of points, NP-by-ND.
%   DISTS is a NP-by-1 array containing the distances to the nearest
%   neighbor.
%
%   This functions first computes the Delaunay triangulation of the set of
%   points, then search for nearest distance in the set of each vertex
%   neighbors. This reduces the overall complexity, but difference was
%   noticed only for large sets (>10000 points)
%
%   Example
%     % Display Stienen diagram of a set of random points in unit square
%     pts = rand(100, 2);
%     [dists, inds] = nndist(pts);
%     figure; drawPoint(pts, 'k.');
%     hold on; drawCircle([pts dists/2], 'b');
%     axis equal; axis([-.1 1.1 -.1 1.1]);
%     % also display edges
%     drawEdge([pts pts(inds, :)], 'b');
