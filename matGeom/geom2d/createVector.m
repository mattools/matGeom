function vect = createVector(p1, p2)
%CREATEVECTOR Create a vector from two points.
%
%   V12 = createVector(P1, P2)
%   Creates the vector V12, defined as the difference between coordinates
%   of points P1 and P2.
%   P1 and P2 are row vectors with ND elements, ND being the space
%   dimension.
%
%   If one of the inputs is a N-by-Nd array, the other input is
%   automatically repeated, and the result is N-by-Nd.
%
%   If both inputs have the same size, the result also have the same size.
