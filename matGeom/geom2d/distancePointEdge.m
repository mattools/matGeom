function [dist, pos] = distancePointEdge(point, edge)
%DISTANCEPOINTEDGE Minimum distance between a point and an edge.
%
%   DIST = distancePointEdge(POINT, EDGE);
%   Return the euclidean distance between edge EDGE and point POINT. 
%   EDGE has the form: [x1 y1 x2 y2], and POINT is [x y].
%
%   If EDGE is N-by-4 array, result is 1-by-4 array computed for each edge.
%   If POINT is a N-by-2 array, the result is a N-by-1 array.
%   If both POINT and EDGE are array, the result is computed for each
%   point-edge couple, and stored into a NP-by-NE array.
%
%   [DIST POS] = distancePointEdge(POINT, EDGE);
%   Also returns the position of closest point on the edge. POS is
%   comprised between 0 (first point) and 1 (last point).
