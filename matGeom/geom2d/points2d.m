function points2d
%POINTS2D  Description of functions operating on points.
%
%   A point is defined by its two cartesian coordinate, put into a row
%   vector of 2 elements:
%   P = [x y];
%
%   Several points are stored in a matrix with two columns, one for the
%   x-coordinate, one for the y-coordinate.
%   PTS = [x1 y1 ; x2 y2 ; x3 y3];
%   
%   Example
%   P = [5 6];
