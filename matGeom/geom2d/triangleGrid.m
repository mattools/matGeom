function varargout = triangleGrid(bounds, origin, size, varargin)
%TRIANGLEGRID Generate triangular grid of points in the plane.
%
%   usage
%   PTS = triangleGrid(BOUNDS, ORIGIN, SIZE)
%   generate points, lying in the window defined by BOUNDS, given in form
%   [xmin ymin xmax ymax], starting from origin with a constant step equal
%   to size. 
%   SIZE is constant and is equals to the length of the sides of each
%   triangles.
