function theta = lineAngle(varargin)
%LINEANGLE Computes angle between two straight lines.
%
%   A = lineAngle(LINE);
%   Returns the angle between horizontal, right-axis and the given line.
%   Angle is given in radians, between 0 and 2*pi, in counter-clockwise
%   direction.
%
%   A = lineAngle(LINE1, LINE2);
%   Returns the directed angle between the two lines. Angle is given in
%   radians between 0 and 2*pi, in counter-clockwise direction.
