 Version 0.6 04-Sep-2017 .

   The aim of this package is to provide functions to easily create,  
   modify and display geometric graphs (geometric in a sense position
   nodes are associated to geometric position in 2D or 3D).

   Graph are represented by a structure with at least two arrays:
   * NODES, which contains coordinates of each vertex
   * EDGES, which contains indices of start and end vertex.
   Some graph functions consider adjacency list, as a cell array where
   each cell contains the indices of the neighbor vertices.

   Others arrays may sometimes be used:
   * FACES, which contains indices of vertices of each face (either a
       double array, or a cell array)
   * CELLS, which contains indices of faces of each cell.

   An alternative representation is to use a structure, with fields:
   * 'nodes'
   * 'edges'
   corresponding to the data described above.

   Note that topological description of 2D graph is entirely contained in
   EDGES array, and that NODES array is used only to display the graph.
   
   Caution: this type of data structure is easy to create and to manage,
   but may be very inefficient for some algorithms. 

   Graphs are usually considered as non-oriented in this package.
