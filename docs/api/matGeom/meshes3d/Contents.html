 Version 1.22 06-Jun-2018.

   Creation, visualization, and manipulation of 3D surface meshes or
   polyhedra.

   Meshes and Polyhedra are represented by a couple of variables {V, F}:
   V: Nv-by-3 array of vertices: [x1 y1 z1; ... ; xn yn zn];
   F: is either a NF-by-3 or NF-by-4 array containing reference for
   vertices of each face, or a NF-by-1 cell array, where each cell is an
   array containing a variable number of node indices.
   For some functions, the array E of edges is needed. It consists in a
   NE-by-2 array containing indices of source and target vertices. 

   The library provides function to create basic polyhedric meshes (the
   five platonic solids, plus few others), as well as functions to perform
   basic computations (surface area, normal angles, face centroids...).
   The 'MengerSponge' structure is an example of mesh that is not simply
   connected (multiple tunnels in the structure).

   The drawMesh function is mainly a wrapper to the Matlab 'patch'
   function, allowing passing arguments more quickly.

   Example
     % create a soccer ball mesh and display it
     [v, e, f] = createSoccerBall;
     drawMesh(v, f, 'faceColor', 'g', 'linewidth', 2);
     axis equal; view(3);
