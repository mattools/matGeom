<Info description="MatGeom is a library for geometry processing / geometric computing with MATLAB in 2D and 3D. MatGeom is a “function-based” library: it contains several hundreds of functions for the creation, manipulation and display of 2D and 3D shapes such as point sets, lines, ellipses, polygons, 3D polygonal meshes... The official homepage for the project is http://github.com/mattools/matGeom.&#10;&#10;A user manual containing a large number of illustrations and examples is available. Starting from February 2022, the HTML pages of the functions (obtained with m2html) are available here.&#10;&#10;The MatGeom library corresponds to the concatenation of the &quot;geom2d&quot; and &quot;geom3d&quot; libraries that were distributed on the FileExchange. Distribution as a single library greatly facilitates the interoperability of the functions.&#10;&#10;Thanks to the work of other people (mostly Juan Pablo Carbajal), a port of MatGeom for the GNU Octave language is available at https://gnu-octave.github.io/packages/matgeom/.&#10;&#10;If you use MatGeom for your research, please be kind enough to cite the following article:&#10;&#10;Legland, D.
